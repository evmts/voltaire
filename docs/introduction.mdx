## What's Unique?

- **[Branded Types](/getting-started/branded-types)** - Ethereum TypeScript types that are strongly validated at runtime. Eliminates bugs common to Ethereum applications such as casing errors, comparing addresses, or passing in a hex where it expects an address.
- **[WASM-Accelerated](/getting-started/wasm)** - High-performance implementations for cryptography, encoding, and EVM execution written in Zig.
- **[LLM-Optimized](/getting-started/llm-optimized)** - API mirrors the Ethereum specification. Lots of time has been put into polishing the [MCP server](/mcp) and [llms.txt](/llms.txt) along with the docs themselves.
- **[Multiplatform](/getting-started/multiplatform)** - Works everywhere: TypeScript in Node.js, browsers, serverless, and any language with C-FFI support. Utilizes advances in AI to maintain consistent API across multiple programming languages and platforms.
- **[Powerful Features](/getting-started/powerful-features)** - Features common to all general-purpose Ethereum libraries, plus unique ones exclusive to Voltaire such as EVM execution and bytecode analysis.
