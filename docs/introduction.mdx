## What's Included

<Columns>
  <Card title="JSON-RPC Provider" icon="network-wired">
    A shadcn style json-rpc provider interface customized for your codebase.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Primitives" icon="cube">
    Typesafe and featureful primitives such as Abi, Address, Bytecode, Ens, Chain, Opcodes, and Hardforks and more.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cryptography" icon="lock">
    High performance wasm based cryptography.
  </Card>
  <Card title="EVM" icon="bolt">
    Execution primitives to process bytecode and execute the Evm.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## What's Unique?

- **[Branded Types](/getting-started/branded-types)** - Eliminate entire classes of bugs with runtime-validated branded types that encode validation state directly into TypeScript's type system, preventing accidental misuse like mixing up addresses and raw hex strings.
- **[WASM-Accelerated](/getting-started/wasm)** - High-performance WASM implementations for cryptography, encoding, and EVM execution.
- **[LLM-Optimized](/getting-started/llm-optimized)** - Built from the ground up to be simple for both humans and LLMs. API mirrors Ethereum specification with MCP server enabling AI-assisted development.
- **[Multiplatform](/getting-started/multiplatform)** - Works everywhere: TypeScript in Node.js, browsers, and any language with C-FFI support. Utilizes advances in AI to maintain consistent API across multiple programming languages and platforms.
- **[Powerful Features](/getting-started/powerful-features)** - Features never before available in general-purpose TypeScript Ethereum libraries, such as EVM execution support, alongside the essential primitives, cryptography, and provider functionality.
