## What's Unique?

- **[Branded Types](/getting-started/branded-types)** - Built with powerful Ethereum types that are checked both by the TypeScript type checker and at runtime. Eliminates bugs common to Ethereum applications.
- **[WASM-Accelerated](/getting-started/wasm)** - High-performance implementations for cryptography, encoding, and EVM execution written in Zig.
- **[LLM-Optimized](/getting-started/llm-optimized)** - API mirrors the Ethereum specification. Highly tested [MCP server](/mcp) and [llms.txt](/llms.txt).
- **[Multiplatform](/getting-started/multiplatform)** - Works everywhere: TypeScript in Node.js, browsers, serverless, and any language with C-FFI support. Utilizes advances in AI to maintain consistent API across multiple programming languages and platforms.
- **[Powerful Features](/getting-started/powerful-features)** - EVM execution, bytecode analysis, ENS, Sign-in with Ethereum, and cryptography.
