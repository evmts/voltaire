## What's Unique?

- **[Branded Types](/getting-started/branded-types)** - Modern typesafety with runtime validated types using type-level tags that make structurally identical types distinguishable.
- **[Zig-Wasm-Accelerated](/getting-started/wasm)** - High-performance WASM implementations built with Zig for cryptography and encoding.
- **[Tree-Shakeable](/getting-started/tree-shaking)** - Import only what you need with unused code automatically excluded from bundles.
- **[LLM-Optimized](/getting-started/llm-optimized)** - API mirrors Ethereum specification with MCP server enabling AI-assisted development.
- **[Multiplatform](/getting-started/multiplatform)** - Works everywhere: TypeScript, Zig, and any language with C-FFI support.
- **[Powerful Features](/getting-started/powerful-features)** - Primitives, cryptography, EVM utils, providers. Everything needed to build on Ethereum.
