## Type Aliases

### ProofLike

> **ProofLike** = [`ProofType`](#prooftype) \| \{ `proof`: readonly `Uint8Array`[]; `value`: `Uint8Array`; \}

Defined in: [src/primitives/Proof/ProofType.ts:33](https://github.com/evmts/voltaire/blob/bd6ec34405c15ad8cd51d11579d495dc53813482/src/primitives/Proof/ProofType.ts#L33)

Inputs that can be converted to Proof

### ProofType

> **ProofType** = `object`

Defined in: [src/primitives/Proof/ProofType.ts:15](https://github.com/evmts/voltaire/blob/bd6ec34405c15ad8cd51d11579d495dc53813482/src/primitives/Proof/ProofType.ts#L15)

Proof represents a generic Merkle proof for verifying inclusion in a Merkle tree.

A Merkle proof consists of:
- value: The leaf value being proven
- proof: An array of sibling hashes forming the path from leaf to root

To verify, you hash the value with each proof element in order, reconstructing
the path to the root hash. If the final hash matches the known root, the proof
is valid.

This generic structure is used as the basis for more specific proof types like
StateProof and StorageProof which follow the Ethereum Merkle Patricia Trie format.

#### Properties

##### proof

> `readonly` **proof**: readonly `Uint8Array`[]

Defined in: [src/primitives/Proof/ProofType.ts:27](https://github.com/evmts/voltaire/blob/bd6ec34405c15ad8cd51d11579d495dc53813482/src/primitives/Proof/ProofType.ts#L27)

Array of sibling hashes forming the Merkle branch.
Each element is a node hash encountered on the path from leaf to root.
Order matters - typically bottom-up (leaf to root).

##### value

> `readonly` **value**: `Uint8Array`

Defined in: [src/primitives/Proof/ProofType.ts:20](https://github.com/evmts/voltaire/blob/bd6ec34405c15ad8cd51d11579d495dc53813482/src/primitives/Proof/ProofType.ts#L20)

The leaf value being proven for inclusion.
This is typically a hash or encoded data.

## Functions

### equals()

> **equals**(`a`, `b`): `boolean`

Defined in: [src/primitives/Proof/equals.js:20](https://github.com/evmts/voltaire/blob/bd6ec34405c15ad8cd51d11579d495dc53813482/src/primitives/Proof/equals.js#L20)

Compares two Proofs for equality.
Both value and all proof elements must match.

#### Parameters

##### a

[`ProofType`](#prooftype)

First Proof

##### b

[`ProofType`](#prooftype)

Second Proof

#### Returns

`boolean`

- True if equal

#### Example

```typescript
const isEqual = Proof.equals(proof1, proof2);
```

***

### from()

> **from**(`proof`): [`ProofType`](#prooftype)

Defined in: [src/primitives/Proof/from.js:22](https://github.com/evmts/voltaire/blob/bd6ec34405c15ad8cd51d11579d495dc53813482/src/primitives/Proof/from.js#L22)

Creates a Proof from an object with value and proof array.

#### Parameters

##### proof

[`ProofLike`](#prooflike)

Object containing value and proof array

#### Returns

[`ProofType`](#prooftype)

- A validated Proof

#### Example

```typescript
const proof = Proof.from({
  value: leafValue,
  proof: [hash1, hash2, hash3],
});
```
