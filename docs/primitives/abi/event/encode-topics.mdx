## Usage Examples

### Filter by Single Address

```typescript
import { Event } from '@tevm/voltaire'

const transferEvent = new Event({
  type: "event",
  name: "Transfer",
  inputs: [
    { type: "address", name: "from", indexed: true },
    { type: "address", name: "to", indexed: true },
    { type: "uint256", name: "value" }
  ]
})

// Get all transfers FROM specific address
const topics = transferEvent.encodeTopics({
  from: "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f51e3e"
})

const logs = await provider.getLogs({
  address: tokenAddress,
  topics: topics
})
```

### Filter by Multiple Criteria

```typescript
import { Event } from '@tevm/voltaire'

const transferEvent = new Event({
  type: "event",
  name: "Transfer",
  inputs: [
    { type: "address", name: "from", indexed: true },
    { type: "address", name: "to", indexed: true },
    { type: "uint256", name: "value" }
  ]
})

// Get transfers FROM one address TO another
const topics = transferEvent.encodeTopics({
  from: "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f51e3e",
  to: "0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4"
})

const logs = await provider.getLogs({
  address: tokenAddress,
  topics: topics
})
```

### Partial Filtering

```typescript
import { Event } from '@tevm/voltaire'

const transferEvent = new Event({
  type: "event",
  name: "Transfer",
  inputs: [
    { type: "address", name: "from", indexed: true },
    { type: "address", name: "to", indexed: true },
    { type: "uint256", name: "value" }
  ]
})

// Only filter by TO address (FROM is any)
const topics = transferEvent.encodeTopics({
  to: "0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4"
})

// Topics array: [selector, null, toAddress]
const logs = await provider.getLogs({
  address: tokenAddress,
  topics: topics
})
```
