## Usage Notes

`wasRemoved()` is functionally identical to `isRemoved()`:

```typescript
// Both equivalent
const removed1 = log.isRemoved();
const removed2 = log.wasRemoved();
```

Use whichever name is clearer in context. `wasRemoved()` emphasizes past tense; `isRemoved()` emphasizes current state.
