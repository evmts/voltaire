## Usage Notes

`getIndexed()` is functionally identical to `getIndexedTopics()`:

```typescript
// Both equivalent
const indexed1 = log.getIndexedTopics();
const indexed2 = log.getIndexed();
```

Use whichever name is clearer in context. `getIndexed()` is shorter; `getIndexedTopics()` is more explicit.
