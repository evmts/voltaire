## Usage Notes

`getSignature()` is functionally identical to `getTopic0()`. Use whichever name is clearer in context:

```typescript
// Both equivalent
const sig1 = log.getTopic0();
const sig2 = log.getSignature();
```

The name "signature" emphasizes that topic0 typically contains the event signature hash for non-anonymous events.
