## Overview

Block represents a complete Ethereum block with header, body, hash, and metadata. Used for block validation, storage, and propagation.

```typescript
import * as Block from '@voltaire/primitives/Block'

const block = Block.from({
  header: blockHeader,
  body: blockBody,
  hash: "0x1234567890abcdef...",
  size: 1024n,
  totalDifficulty: 12345678n, // Optional, pre-merge only
})
```

## Type Definition

```typescript
type BlockType = {
  readonly header: BlockHeaderType
  readonly body: BlockBodyType
  readonly hash: BlockHashType
  readonly size: Uint256Type
  readonly totalDifficulty?: Uint256Type
}
```

**Fields:**
- `header` - Block metadata and Merkle roots
- `body` - Transactions, uncles/ommers, withdrawals
- `hash` - Keccak256(RLP(header))
- `size` - Block size in bytes (RLP-encoded)
- `totalDifficulty` - Cumulative difficulty (pre-merge only)

## Creating Blocks

### from

Universal constructor from block components.

```typescript
import * as Block from '@voltaire/primitives/Block'
import * as BlockHeader from '@voltaire/primitives/BlockHeader'
import * as BlockBody from '@voltaire/primitives/BlockBody'

const header = BlockHeader.from({
  parentHash: "0x...",
  // ... other header fields
})

const body = BlockBody.from({
  transactions: [tx1, tx2],
  ommers: [],
  withdrawals: [w1, w2],
})

const block = Block.from({
  header,
  body,
  hash: "0xabc123...",
  size: 2048n,
})
```

## Block Components

A complete block consists of:

1. **Header** - Metadata and Merkle roots for verification
2. **Body** - Actual content (transactions, uncles, withdrawals)
3. **Hash** - Unique block identifier computed from header
4. **Size** - Total RLP-encoded size in bytes

## Post-Merge Changes

After The Merge (September 2022):
- `totalDifficulty` is no longer relevant
- Proof-of-Work fields in header are zeroed
- Beacon chain handles consensus

```typescript
// Pre-merge block
const premerge = Block.from({
  header,
  body,
  hash: "0x...",
  size: 1024n,
  totalDifficulty: 58750003716598352816469n,
})

// Post-merge block (no totalDifficulty)
const postmerge = Block.from({
  header,
  body,
  hash: "0x...",
  size: 1024n,
})
```
