title: Compute Contract Address (CREATE/CREATE2)
description: Calculate deterministic contract deployment addresses for CREATE and CREATE2.
---

## CREATE Address

Contract address from deployer + nonce:

```ts
import { Keccak256 } from '@voltaire/crypto/Keccak256'
import * as Address from '@voltaire/primitives/Address'

const deployer = Address.from('0x742d35cc6634c0532925a3b844bc9e7595f2bd6e')
const nonce = 5n

// Using Keccak256.contractAddress helper
const contractAddr = Keccak256.contractAddress(deployer, nonce)
```

Formula: `keccak256(rlp([sender, nonce]))[12:32]`

## CREATE2 Address

Deterministic address from deployer + salt + initCode:

```ts
import { Keccak256 } from '@voltaire/crypto/Keccak256'
import * as Address from '@voltaire/primitives/Address'
import * as Hash from '@voltaire/primitives/Hash'
import * as Bytecode from '@voltaire/primitives/Bytecode'

const deployer = Address.from('0x742d35cc6634c0532925a3b844bc9e7595f2bd6e')
const salt = Hash.from(123n)  // 32-byte salt
const initCode = Bytecode.from('0x6080604052...')

const contractAddr = Keccak256.create2Address(deployer, salt, initCode)
```

Formula: `keccak256(0xff ++ sender ++ salt ++ keccak256(initCode))[12:32]`

## Using Address Namespace

```ts
import * as Address from '@voltaire/primitives/Address'
import * as Hash from '@voltaire/primitives/Hash'
import * as Bytecode from '@voltaire/primitives/Bytecode'

const deployer = Address.from('0x...')

// CREATE
const addr1 = Address.calculateCreateAddress(deployer, 0n)

// CREATE2
const salt = Hash.from(0n)
const code = Bytecode.from('0x...')
const addr2 = Address.calculateCreate2Address(deployer, salt, code)
```

## Factory Pattern

Common for counterfactual deployments:

```ts
import { Keccak256 } from '@voltaire/crypto/Keccak256'
import * as Address from '@voltaire/primitives/Address'
import * as Hash from '@voltaire/primitives/Hash'

const factory = Address.from('0x...factory...')

// Same salt + initCode = same address on any chain
const salt = Hash.fromString('my-unique-salt')
const initCode = /* contract bytecode */

const predicted = Keccak256.create2Address(factory, salt, initCode)
```
