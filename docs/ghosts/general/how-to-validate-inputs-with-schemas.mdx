title: Validate Inputs With Schemas (Do Not Cast Types)
description: Use runtime schemas to validate unknown data instead of TypeScript casts.
---

## Goal

Avoid unsafe `as` casting at runtime. Validate inputs using Effect Schema so bad data fails early and loudly.

## Why Casting Is Unsafe

TypeScript casts only affect the compiler. They do **not** validate data at runtime.

```ts
// ❌ This compiles even if input is "not-an-address"
const address = input as `0x${string}`
```

If `input` is wrong, you still get runtime failures later (or worse, silently wrong behavior).

## Use Schemas Instead

Decode unknown data at the boundary (RPC, file input, user input, env vars) and only pass validated values deeper into your app.

### Example: Validate an Address

```ts
import * as S from 'effect/Schema'
import * as Address from 'voltaire-effect/primitives/Address'

const parseAddress = (input: unknown) =>
  S.decodeUnknownSync(Address.Hex)(input)

const address = parseAddress('0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f251e3')
// address is AddressType and validated at runtime
```

### Example: Validate a Request Shape

```ts
import * as S from 'effect/Schema'
import * as Address from 'voltaire-effect/primitives/Address'

const GetBalanceRequest = S.Struct({
  address: Address.Hex,
  blockTag: S.optional(S.String)
})

const request = S.decodeUnknownSync(GetBalanceRequest)(input)
// request.address is validated; request.blockTag is optional
```

### Example: Validate ABI Arrays

```ts
import * as S from 'effect/Schema'
import * as AbiSchema from 'voltaire-effect/primitives/Abi'

const erc20Abi = S.decodeUnknownSync(AbiSchema.fromArray)([
  {
    type: 'function',
    name: 'balanceOf',
    stateMutability: 'view',
    inputs: [{ name: 'account', type: 'address' }],
    outputs: [{ name: 'balance', type: 'uint256' }]
  }
])
```

## Rule of Thumb

- **Never** use `as` or `unknown as` on untrusted data.
- **Always** use schemas to validate at runtime at the boundary.
