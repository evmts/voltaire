## Decode from Hex

Decodes deployed contract bytecode from hex string.

```typescript
import { describe, expect, it } from "@effect/vitest"
import * as S from "effect/Schema"
import * as RuntimeCode from "voltaire-effect/primitives/RuntimeCode"

const result = S.decodeSync(RuntimeCode.Hex)("0x6080604052")
expect(result).toBeInstanceOf(Uint8Array)
```

## Handle Empty Bytecode

Handles empty bytecode (0x).

```typescript
import * as S from "effect/Schema"
import * as RuntimeCode from "voltaire-effect/primitives/RuntimeCode"

const result = S.decodeSync(RuntimeCode.Hex)("0x")
expect(result.length).toBe(0)
```

## Encode to Hex

Encodes bytecode back to hex string.

```typescript
import * as S from "effect/Schema"
import * as RuntimeCode from "voltaire-effect/primitives/RuntimeCode"

const code = S.decodeSync(RuntimeCode.Hex)("0x6080604052")
const hex = S.encodeSync(RuntimeCode.Hex)(code)
expect(hex).toBe("0x6080604052")
```

## Decode from Bytes

Decodes from Uint8Array.

```typescript
import * as S from "effect/Schema"
import * as RuntimeCode from "voltaire-effect/primitives/RuntimeCode"

const input = new Uint8Array([0x60, 0x80, 0x60, 0x40])
const result = S.decodeSync(RuntimeCode.Bytes)(input)
expect([...result]).toEqual([...input])
```

## Encode to Bytes

Encodes to Uint8Array.

```typescript
import * as S from "effect/Schema"
import * as RuntimeCode from "voltaire-effect/primitives/RuntimeCode"

const code = S.decodeSync(RuntimeCode.Hex)("0x6001")
const bytes = S.encodeSync(RuntimeCode.Bytes)(code)
expect(bytes).toBeInstanceOf(Uint8Array)
```
