# Ghosts Directory

This directory contains additional documentation for LLM context via the MCP server.

## Purpose

The "ghosts" are supplementary how-to guides and examples that:
- Provide extra context to AI assistants using the Voltaire MCP server
- Are NOT included in the main Mintlify navigation (docs.json)
- Cover common tasks and patterns users ask about

## Structure

- `account-abstraction/` - ERC-4337, smart accounts
- `contracts/` - Contract interaction patterns
- `crypto/` - Cryptographic operations
- `defi/` - DeFi protocol interactions
- `encoding/` - ABI, RLP encoding patterns
- `events/` - Event listening and parsing
- `general/` - General Ethereum concepts
- `l2/` - Layer 2 specific guides
- `mcp-evals/` - MCP server evaluation tests
- `network/` - Network and provider patterns
- `nft/` - NFT operations
- `provider/` - Provider configuration
- `security/` - Security best practices
- `signatures/` - Signing and verification
- `testing/` - Testing patterns
- `tests/` - Test fixtures
- `tokens/` - Token operations (ERC-20, etc.)
- `transactions/` - Transaction building and sending
- `wallet/` - Wallet operations

## Usage

These files are indexed by the MCP server's SearchVoltaire tool to provide relevant context when users ask questions. They supplement the main documentation with practical examples.

## Not for Navigation

These pages are intentionally excluded from docs.json navigation. They exist purely as LLM context, not as user-facing documentation pages.
