title: Uniswap V2 Factory — Deployment Block Number
description: Find the block number where the Uniswap V2 Factory contract was deployed.
---

## Goal

Given the Uniswap V2 Factory contract address, find the block number it was deployed at.

Return as:

ANSWER: <block_number>

## Contract

- Uniswap V2 Factory: 0x5C69bEe701ef814a2B6a3EDD4B1652CB9cc5aA6f

## Approach

1. Binary search over blocks for the earliest non-empty `eth_getCode` result.
2. Or scan logs for a known factory event and fetch the block number of the first occurrence.

## Example (TypeScript)

```ts
import { createPublicClient, http } from 'viem'
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains'

const client = createPublicClient({ chain: mainnet, transport: http(process.env.ETHEREUM_RPC_URL!) })
const FACTORY = '0x5C69bEe701ef814a2B6a3EDD4B1652CB9cc5aA6f'

async function deployedAt(): Promise<bigint> {
  let lo = 0n
  let hi = (await client.getBlockNumber())
  while (lo < hi) {
    const mid = (lo + hi) >> 1n
    const code = await client.getBytecode({ address: FACTORY as `0x${string}`, blockNumber: mid }).catch(() => null)
    if (code && code !== '0x') hi = mid
    else lo = mid + 1n
  }
  return lo
}

const block = await deployedAt()
console.log(`ANSWER: ${block}`)
```
