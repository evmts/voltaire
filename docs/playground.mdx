Welcome to the Voltaire Playground. Experiment with primitives and examples directly in your browser.

- Direct link: <a href="/playground/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Open full Playground</a>
- Local dev: start it with `cd playground && bun run dev` (served at `http://localhost:5173`)

<div style={{ marginTop: 16, borderRadius: 8, overflow: 'hidden', border: '1px solid #e5e7eb' }}>
  <iframe
    src="/playground/"
    title="Voltaire Playground"
    style={{ width: '100%', height: '75vh', border: '0' }}
  />
</div>

Note: The embedded version is served from your docs static assets at `/playground/`. If you don’t see it locally, run `bun run docs:playground:build` to build and copy the latest Playground into `docs/public/playground`.
