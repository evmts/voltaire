# Data-First Ethereum

Voltaire takes a **data-first approach** to Ethereum primitives. Core types are validated [branded types](/concepts/branded-types) that separate data from operations, enabling maximum tree-shakeability and flexibility.

## Philosophy

**Data comes first.** We default to the most simple structure with runtime validation for all types. Ethereum primitives are represented using the most idiomatic data type for each language that closely matches what the data actually is:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="TypeScript">

- **Addresses** → 20-byte `Uint8Array`
- **Hashes** → 32-byte `Uint8Array`
- **Bytecode** → Variable-length `Uint8Array`
- **Hex strings** → Tagged `string`

These [branded types](/concepts/branded-types) provide TypeScript safety with minimal runtime overhead. Methods operate on these types rather than encapsulating them in classes.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Zig">

- **Addresses** → `struct { bytes: [20]u8 }`
- **Hashes** → `[32]u8`
- **Bytecode** → `[]const u8` (slice)
- **Hex strings** → `[]const u8` (slice)

Structs and slices provide zero-cost abstractions. Functions operate on these types using idiomatic Zig patterns.
