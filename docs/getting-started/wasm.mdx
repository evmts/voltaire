title: Zig Accelerated
description: High-performance WASM implementations built with Zig
---

Provides up to 3x performance boosts for common cryptography such as Keccak256, and up to 100x performance improvement for computationally expensive operations.

Zig excels at building small bundle sizes for WASM compared to other languages like Rust. Voltaire carefully optimizes WASM bundle sizes to keep them minimal. WASM is highly portable - it works on mobile phones, browsers, Node.js, and anywhere JavaScript runs.

## Implementation Options

Voltaire provides multiple implementation choices:

1. **Default (WASM)** - Balanced performance and bundle size
2. **WASM (explicit)** - Same as default, explicit import path
3. **TypeScript** - Pure TypeScript, no WASM dependency
4. **Assembly** - Maximum speed using native assembly

```typescript
import { keccak256 } from '@tevm/voltaire/crypto';        // Default (WASM)
import { keccak256 } from '@tevm/voltaire/crypto/wasm';  // WASM (explicit)
import { keccak256 } from '@tevm/voltaire/crypto/ts';    // TypeScript
import { keccak256 } from '@tevm/voltaire/crypto/asm';   // Assembly
```

The APIs are identical - you can swap implementations without changing your code. Start with the default WASM for balanced performance, switch to TypeScript when you need no WASM dependency, or use assembly for maximum raw performance.

<Note>
By default, Voltaire chooses what we believe to be the most balanced trade-offs between performance, bundle size, and other concerns like debuggability.
</Note>

<Warning>
The assembly version (`/asm`) uses native assembly optimizations and is not audited. Use only when you need absolute maximum performance and understand the security implications.
