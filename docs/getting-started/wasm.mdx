title: High-Performance Implementations
description: Optimized implementations balancing performance and bundle size
---

High-performance implementations that minimize bundle size while maximizing performance.

Tevm provides WASM implementations built in Zig for computationally expensive operations, along with pure TypeScript implementations where WASM overhead doesn't justify the complexity.

## Implementation Options

Tevm usually provides at least two implementation options for most APIs:

1. **Default** - What we think is the best trade-off between performance, bundle size, and other considerations
2. **TypeScript** - Pure TypeScript implementation with no WASM dependency
3. **WASM** - WASM-accelerated implementation for better performance

Based on our benchmarks and bundle size analysis, we pick the default for each API. For example, Keccak256 uses WASM by default because it's both faster and smaller than pure JavaScript alternatives.

```typescript
import { Keccak256 } from 'tevm/crypto';           // Default (WASM for Keccak256)
import { Keccak256 } from 'tevm/crypto/Keccak256'; // Explicit default
import { Keccak256Ts } from 'tevm/crypto/keccak256.ts';   // TypeScript
import { Keccak256Wasm } from 'tevm/crypto/keccak256.wasm'; // WASM
```

The APIs are identical across implementations - you can swap them without changing your code.

<Note>
By default, Tevm chooses what we believe to be the best trade-off between performance, bundle size, and other concerns like debuggability.
