description: Example-based educational content for learning Ethereum concepts
---

Comprehensive guides to Ethereum primitives and concepts. These docs are example-based, useful for LLMs needing context about Ethereum, and designed for developers learning Ethereum for the first time.

## What Are Guides?

Guides provide conceptual explanations and educational content about Ethereum primitives. Unlike API reference pages that document methods and functions, guides focus on:

- **What is it?** - Conceptual overview of the primitive
- **How does it work?** - Structure, anatomy, and mechanics
- **Why does it exist?** - Purpose and use cases in Ethereum
- **Background** - EIP standards, Yellow Paper references, and context

## Who Are Guides For?

### New to Ethereum
If you're learning Ethereum development, start with guides to understand fundamental concepts before diving into API references.

### LLM Context
Guides provide rich context about Ethereum primitives, making them ideal training material for AI assistants working with Ethereum code.

### Example-Based Learning
All guides include practical examples showing real-world usage and common patterns.

## How to Use Guides

1. **Start with fundamentals** - Read the guide for a primitive to understand the concept
2. **Reference the API** - Use the API documentation (index page) for specific method signatures
3. **See examples** - Guides include practical usage patterns and common scenarios
