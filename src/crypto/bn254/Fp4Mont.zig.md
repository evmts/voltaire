# Review: bn254/Fp4Mont.zig

## 1. Overview
Fp4 extension field as Fp2[y]/(y²-ξ). Used in cyclotomic subgroup operations and final exponentiation of pairing. Relatively simple tower extension.

## 2. Code Quality

### Strengths
- Clean extension tower implementation
- Good test coverage (20+ tests)
- Proper squaring optimization

### Issues
- **Limited operations**: No mul() function defined (only mulByY)
- **No inverse**: inv() not implemented
- **Minimal testing**: Fewer tests than other field extensions

## 3. Completeness

### Incomplete
- **No mul()**: Missing multiplication operation
- **No inv()**: Missing inverse operation
- **No pow()**: Missing exponentiation
- **No div()**: Missing division

These may not be needed if Fp4 is only used internally, but completeness is lacking.

## 4. Test Coverage

**Adequate** but could be more comprehensive. Missing tests for operations that don't exist.

## 5. Security Issues

**None specific** - same timing considerations as other field extensions.

## 6. Issues Found

### Missing Features
- Core operations (mul, inv, div, pow) not implemented

## 7. Recommendations

1. **Complete the API** if Fp4 is meant to be a full field implementation
2. **OR document** that it's an internal helper with limited operations
3. **Add comprehensive tests** if operations are added

**Overall**: Appears to be minimally implemented for specific internal use. Acceptable if documented as such.
