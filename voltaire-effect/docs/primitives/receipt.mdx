```typescript
import * as Receipt from 'voltaire-effect/primitives/Receipt'
import * as Schema from 'effect/Schema'

const receipt = Schema.decodeSync(Receipt.Schema)(receiptData)
```

## Schemas

**ReceiptSchema** — Full receipt: status, gas usage, logs.

```typescript
Schema.decodeSync(Receipt.Schema)({
  transactionHash: txHash,
  blockNumber: 12345n,
  blockHash: blockHash,
  transactionIndex: 0,
  from: '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890',
  to: '0xabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcd',
  cumulativeGasUsed: 21000n,
  gasUsed: 21000n,
  contractAddress: null,
  logs: [],
  logsBloom: new Uint8Array(256),
  status: 1
})
```

**LogSchema** — Event log emitted during execution.

## Types

```typescript
interface ReceiptType {
  readonly transactionHash: HashType
  readonly blockNumber: bigint
  readonly blockHash: HashType
  readonly transactionIndex: number
  readonly from: AddressType
  readonly to: AddressType | null
  readonly cumulativeGasUsed: bigint
  readonly gasUsed: bigint
  readonly contractAddress: AddressType | null
  readonly logs: readonly LogType[]
  readonly logsBloom: Uint8Array
  readonly status: 0 | 1  // 0 = failed, 1 = success
}

interface LogType {
  readonly address: AddressType
  readonly topics: readonly HashType[]
  readonly data: Uint8Array
  readonly blockNumber: bigint
  readonly transactionHash: HashType
  readonly transactionIndex: number
  readonly blockHash: HashType
  readonly logIndex: number
  readonly removed: boolean
}
```
