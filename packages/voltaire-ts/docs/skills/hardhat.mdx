# Hardhat Integration

This Skill will provide seamless integration between Voltaire and Hardhat for Solidity development.

## Planned Features

- **Hardhat Network** — Connect Voltaire providers to Hardhat's built-in network
- **Artifact Loading** — Import ABIs and bytecode from Hardhat's `artifacts/` directory
- **Task Integration** — Use Voltaire primitives in custom Hardhat tasks
- **Plugin API** — Extend Hardhat Runtime Environment with Voltaire
- **TypeChain Compatibility** — Work alongside TypeChain-generated types

## Example Usage (Proposed)

```typescript
import { hardhat } from "./skills/hardhat/index.js";
import * as Address from "@voltaire/primitives/Address";
import * as Hex from "@voltaire/primitives/Hex";

// Connect to Hardhat Network
const hre = await hardhat.connect();

// Load contract from Hardhat artifacts
const Token = await hardhat.loadArtifact("artifacts/contracts/Token.sol/Token.json");

// Deploy using Voltaire transaction building
const deployTx = await hre.deploy(Token, {
  args: ["MyToken", "MTK", 18n],
});

const tokenAddress = Address.from(deployTx.contractAddress);

// Interact with deployed contract
const balance = await hre.call({
  to: tokenAddress,
  data: Token.interface.encodeFunctionData("balanceOf", [hre.signer.address]),
});

console.log("Balance:", Hex.toBigInt(balance));
```

## Contributing

To implement this Skill:

1. Fork the [Voltaire repository](https://github.com/evmts/voltaire)
2. Create `examples/hardhat/` directory
3. Implement the integration following [Skills Philosophy](/concepts/skills)
4. Add tests and documentation
5. Submit a PR

Key implementation areas:
- Hardhat Network JSON-RPC client using Voltaire's provider primitives
- Artifact parser for ABI/bytecode from `artifacts/` directory
- HRE extension plugin for adding Voltaire to `hre`
- Task helpers for common deployment patterns
- Test helper utilities for Chai assertions with Voltaire types
