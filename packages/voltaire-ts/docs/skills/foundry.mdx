**Looking for Contributors** — This Skill needs implementation. If you're interested in building Foundry integration for Voltaire, [open an issue](https://github.com/evmts/voltaire/issues) or submit a PR.

# Foundry Integration

This Skill will provide seamless integration between Voltaire and Foundry for Solidity development.

## Planned Features

- **Forge Test Helpers** — Use Voltaire primitives in Forge tests via FFI
- **Anvil Integration** — Connect Voltaire providers to local Anvil nodes
- **Cast Compatibility** — Share transaction building logic between Cast and Voltaire
- **Script Interop** — Use Voltaire for complex off-chain logic in Forge scripts
- **ABI Sync** — Automatic ABI import from Foundry's `out/` directory

## Example Usage (Proposed)

```typescript
import { foundry } from "./skills/foundry/index.js";
import * as Address from "@voltaire/primitives/Address";
import * as Transaction from "@voltaire/primitives/Transaction";

// Connect to local Anvil
const anvil = foundry.anvil({ port: 8545 });

// Load deployed contract from Foundry artifacts
const contract = await foundry.loadContract("out/MyContract.sol/MyContract.json");

// Build transaction using Voltaire
const tx = Transaction.from({
  to: Address.from(contract.address),
  data: contract.interface.encodeFunctionData("mint", [100n]),
});

// Execute and get traces
const result = await anvil.call(tx, { trace: true });
```

## Contributing

To implement this Skill:

1. Fork the [Voltaire repository](https://github.com/evmts/voltaire)
2. Create `examples/foundry/` directory
3. Implement the integration following [Skills Philosophy](/concepts/skills)
4. Add tests and documentation
5. Submit a PR

Key implementation areas:
- Anvil JSON-RPC client using Voltaire's provider primitives
- Foundry artifact parser for ABI/bytecode extraction
- FFI bridge for using Voltaire in Forge tests
- Script execution context for off-chain computation
