title: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
description: Connect AI assistants to live local documentation using MCP servers
---

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) allows AI assistants to access external tools and data sources. Use MCP servers to give Claude and other AI assistants access to your local documentation as you work.

## Live Documentation Viewer

The Playwright MCP server enables Claude to view your local documentation in real-time by:
- Navigating to your local Mintlify dev server
- Taking screenshots of documentation pages
- Inspecting page content and structure
- Verifying visual rendering and layout

This is especially useful for:
- Reviewing documentation changes as you write
- Validating component rendering (tabs, accordions, code blocks)
- Checking visual hierarchy and layout
- Ensuring examples display correctly

## Setup

<Tab title="Claude Code (CLI)">

<Steps>
<Step title="Add MCP Server">

Add the Playwright MCP server using the Claude Code CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add playwright npx @playwright/mcp@latest
```

Verify it's connected:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

You should see `playwright: npx @playwright/mcp@latest - ✓ Connected`.

</Step>

<Step title="Install Playwright Browsers">

Install the Chromium browser:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

This downloads the browser that Playwright uses to render pages.

</Step>

<Step title="Start Local Docs Server">

Start the Mintlify dev server:

```bash
bun run docs:dev
```

Server typically runs at `http://localhost:3002` (or 3000 if available).

</Step>

<Step title="Use in Claude Code">

In Claude Code, ask Claude to view your documentation:

```
Navigate to http://localhost:3002/primitives/bytecode
and take a screenshot
```

Claude can now view, screenshot, and interact with your local docs.

</Step>

<Tab title="Claude Desktop">

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Playwright Browsers">

Install the Chromium browser:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

</Step>

<Step title="Configure Claude Desktop">

Edit your Claude Desktop config file:

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
**Linux:** `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the Playwright MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@playwright/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

</Step>

<Step title="Restart Claude Desktop">

Restart Claude Desktop to load the MCP server.

</Step>

<Step title="Start Local Docs Server">

```bash
bun run docs:dev
```

Server runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

</Step>

## Usage

Ask Claude to view your documentation pages. Examples:

**View a specific page:**
```
Can you navigate to http://localhost:3000/primitives/bytecode/analyze
and take a screenshot?
```

**Review page structure:**
```
Please visit http://localhost:3000/crypto/keccak256 and tell me
if the code examples are displaying correctly.
```

**Check navigation:**
```
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and verify the sidebar navigation
includes all primitive modules.
```

**Validate component rendering:**
```
Go to http://localhost:3000/primitives/address and check if the
tabs are working for Class API vs Namespace API examples.
```

Claude can:
- Navigate to any documentation page
- Take screenshots to visualize layout
- Inspect page content and DOM structure
- Click elements and interact with the page
- Verify links and navigation
- Check responsive design at different viewport sizes

<Note>
As your codebase accumulates more Tevm examples, you'll need the MCP server less frequently. The AI can learn from existing patterns in your code. At that point, we recommend excluding the MCP server from your context since everything the AI needs will already be in your codebase.
</Note>

## Available MCP Tools

The Playwright MCP server provides these tools:

**Navigation:**
- `browser_navigate` - Navigate to URL
- `browser_navigate_back` - Go back to previous page

**Screenshots:**
- `browser_take_screenshot` - Capture full page or specific elements
- `browser_snapshot` - Get accessibility tree snapshot

**Interaction:**
- `browser_click` - Click elements
- `browser_type` - Type into input fields
- `browser_fill_form` - Fill multiple form fields
- `browser_hover` - Hover over elements

**Inspection:**
- `browser_evaluate` - Run JavaScript on page
- `browser_console_messages` - Get console output
- `browser_network_requests` - View network activity

See the [Playwright MCP documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) for complete tool reference.

## Workflow Example

Typical workflow for reviewing documentation changes:

<Steps>
<Step title="Start docs server">

```bash
bun run docs:dev
```

Server runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

</Step>

<Step title="Make documentation changes">

Edit MDX files in `docs/` directory. Mintlify hot-reloads automatically.

</Step>

<Step title="Ask Claude to review">

```
Navigate to http://localhost:3000/primitives/bytecode
and take a screenshot. Does the layout look correct?
```

Claude navigates to the page, captures a screenshot, and provides visual feedback.

</Step>

<Step title="Iterate based on feedback">

Make adjustments based on Claude's observations and repeat.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="MCP server not appearing in Claude Desktop">

**Check config file location:**
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Verify JSON syntax:**
```bash
# macOS
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json | jq .
```

**Restart Claude Desktop** after config changes.

**Check logs** (if available in Claude Desktop developer tools).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cannot connect to localhost:3000">

**Verify Mintlify server is running:**
```bash
lsof -i :3000
```

**Restart the dev server:**
```bash
# Stop existing server (Ctrl+C)
bun run docs:dev
```

**Check browser manually:**
Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to confirm it's accessible.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Playwright browser not launching">

**Install Playwright browsers:**
```bash
npx playwright install
```

**Check installation:**
```bash
npx playwright --version
```

**Try running Playwright directly:**
```bash
npx playwright test --help
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Screenshot quality issues">

**Adjust viewport size:**
Ask Claude to resize the browser:
```
Resize the browser to 1920x1080 before taking the screenshot.
```

**Capture specific elements:**
```
Take a screenshot of just the code block with the keccak256 example.
```

**Use full page screenshots:**
```
Take a full page screenshot to capture everything.
```

</Accordion>
