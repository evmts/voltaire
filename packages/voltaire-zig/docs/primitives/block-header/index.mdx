title: "BlockHeader"
description: "Ethereum block header with metadata and Merkle roots"
---

## Overview

BlockHeader contains all metadata for a block including Merkle roots, gas limits, timestamps, and consensus-related fields. The block hash is computed from RLP(header).

```zig
// Obtain block header via JSON-RPC; map fields from hex to Zig types.
// {"method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["latest",false]}
```

## Type Definition

```zig
// Core fields: parentHash, stateRoot, transactionsRoot, receiptsRoot, logsBloom, gasLimit, gasUsed, timestamp, baseFeePerGas, withdrawalsRoot, blobGasUsed, excessBlobGas, parentBeaconBlockRoot
```

## Creating BlockHeader

### from

Universal constructor with all header fields.

```zig
// Map fields per fork as needed: London (baseFeePerGas), Shanghai (withdrawalsRoot), Cancun (blobGasUsed, excessBlobGas, parentBeaconBlockRoot).
```

## Header Fields by Fork

### Genesis (All Blocks)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| parentHash | Hash of parent block |
| ommersHash | Hash of ommers list RLP |
| beneficiary | Block reward recipient |
| stateRoot | State trie root after execution |
| transactionsRoot | Transactions trie root |
| receiptsRoot | Receipts trie root |
| logsBloom | 256-byte bloom filter for logs |
| difficulty | PoW difficulty (0 post-merge) |
| number | Block height |
| gasLimit | Max gas for block |
| gasUsed | Total gas consumed |
| timestamp | Unix timestamp (seconds) |
| extraData | Arbitrary data (max 32 bytes) |
| mixHash | PoW mix hash (0 post-merge) |
| nonce | PoW nonce (0 post-merge) |

### EIP-1559 (London Fork)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| baseFeePerGas | Dynamic base fee per gas |

### Shanghai Fork

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| withdrawalsRoot | Merkle root of withdrawals |

### EIP-4844 (Cancun Fork)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| blobGasUsed | Total blob gas used |
| excessBlobGas | Excess blob gas for pricing |
| parentBeaconBlockRoot | Beacon chain parent root |

## Post-Merge Changes

After The Merge, several fields are deprecated but still present:

```zig
// Post-merge: difficulty = 0, nonce = 0; mixHash holds RANDAO reveal
```
