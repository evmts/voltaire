# Troubleshooting

## dyld: Library not loaded: libprimitives_ts_native.dylib

- Cause: The native Zig library isn’t on the runtime search path.
- Fix (macOS):
  - Build once: `zig build build-ts-native`
  - Copy the `.dylib` into the app bundle’s `Frameworks` folder (see Xcode Integration), or add `../zig-out/native` to Runpath Search Paths while developing.

## Undefined symbols for architecture … (linker)

- Cause: The native library wasn’t built before Swift compiled/linked.
- Fix: Run `zig build build-ts-native` from the repo root, then rebuild your Swift target.

## Invalid hex / invalid length (runtime)

- Cause: Input failed validation in the underlying primitives.
- Fix: Ensure hex strings are `0x`-prefixed and the expected length (e.g., Address: 20 bytes, Hash/Bytes32: 32 bytes, U256: 32 bytes big-endian). See type docs and `VoltaireError` cases.

## iOS device/simulator build errors

- Cause: Linking a macOS-only build of the Zig library into iOS targets.
- Fix: Build the Zig library for the appropriate Apple platform/arch (device or simulator). Cross-compilation scripts will be documented; for now, file an issue if you need help.
