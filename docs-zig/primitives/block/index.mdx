## Overview

Block represents a complete Ethereum block with header, body, hash, and metadata. Used for block validation, storage, and propagation.

```zig
// Fetch blocks via JSON-RPC and map fields to primitives types as needed.
// {"method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["latest",true]}
```

## Type Definition

```zig
// Use primitives types directly:
// - primitives.BlockHeader, primitives.BlockBody
// - primitives.BlockHash, primitives.BlockNumber, primitives.Hash
```

**Fields:**
- `header` - Block metadata and Merkle roots
- `body` - Transactions, uncles/ommers, withdrawals
- `hash` - Keccak256(RLP(header))
- `size` - Block size in bytes (RLP-encoded)
- `totalDifficulty` - Cumulative difficulty (pre-merge only)

## Creating Blocks

### from

Universal constructor from block components.

```zig
// Build block representations from JSON results; primitives include types for
// header/body fields (e.g., Address, Hash, Transaction) if needed downstream.
```

## Block Components

A complete block consists of:

1. **Header** - Metadata and Merkle roots for verification
2. **Body** - Actual content (transactions, uncles, withdrawals)
3. **Hash** - Unique block identifier computed from header
4. **Size** - Total RLP-encoded size in bytes

## Post-Merge Changes

After The Merge (September 2022):
- `totalDifficulty` is no longer relevant
- Proof-of-Work fields in header are zeroed
- Beacon chain handles consensus

```zig
// Pre-merge vs Post-merge: totalDifficulty exists only pre-merge.
// Inspect the JSON field if you need to distinguish historical blocks.
```
