---

## Overview

BlockBody contains the executable content of a block: transactions, uncle/ommer blocks, and (post-Shanghai) withdrawals.

```zig
// Obtain block body via eth_getBlockByNumber(..., true) for full transaction objects.
```

## Type Definition

```zig
// Transactions, ommers (pre-merge), withdrawals (post-Shanghai)
```

**Fields:**
- `transactions` - Ordered list of transactions in the block
- `ommers` - Uncle/ommer block headers (deprecated post-merge)
- `withdrawals` - Beacon chain withdrawals (post-Shanghai)

## Creating BlockBody

### from

Universal constructor from components.

```zig
// JSON: include 'withdrawals' for post-Shanghai blocks; 'ommers' for pre-merge
```

## Transaction Types

BlockBody supports all transaction types:

| Type | Description | Introduced |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Legacy | Original transaction format | Genesis |
| EIP-2930 | Access list transactions | Berlin |
| EIP-1559 | Fee market transactions | London |
| EIP-4844 | Blob transactions | Cancun |
| EIP-7702 | Account abstraction | Prague |

```zig
// Transaction types: 0 (legacy), 1 (EIP-2930), 2 (EIP-1559), 3 (EIP-4844)
```

## Ommers (Uncle Blocks)

<Warning>
Ommers are deprecated post-merge. Always use empty array for new blocks.
</Warning>

```zig
// Ommers present only pre-merge; empty post-merge
```

## Withdrawals (Post-Shanghai)

Withdrawals represent ETH being withdrawn from the beacon chain to execution layer.

```zig
// Withdrawal fields: index, validatorIndex, address, amount (Gwei)
```

<Note>
Withdrawal amounts are in Gwei (10^9 Wei), not Wei!
</Note>
